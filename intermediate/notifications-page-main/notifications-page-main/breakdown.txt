==========================================

on adding js front, i noticed that when i was getting elements by className, i was not able to turn all
unread elements to read. but when i selected all elements by the tag name which is "div", i was able to
change all the classname instantly.
=================
inorder to get the chess club from getting blue, i had to put !important in the back of the css for it to work as intended.
====================
now all i need to do is,
1. To shift picture to the right side - done, all i had to do was to add a div(with display:flex) then cover the first part of notification with it and set justify-content to "space-around" and boom!
2. To fix the red dot.
